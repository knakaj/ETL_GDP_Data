#### Objectives:
1. Create an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
2. The required information must be accessible as a JSON file  as well as a table in a database file
3. Demonstrate the success of the code by running different queries on the database table, such as displaying only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy.
